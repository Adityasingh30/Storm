# Storm
Storm Runner is a 2D side-scrolling action game developed in Python using the Pygame library. The game features a player character constantly running to escape a massive storm approaching from behind. The player must avoid obstacles, collect power-ups, and survive as long as possible while the game speed increases over time.
