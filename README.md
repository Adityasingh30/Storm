# Storm
“Storm Runner” is a fast-paced 2D side-scrolling game developed using Python and Pygame as part of the "Build Games with Amazon Q CLI" campaign. In this game, players control a character running from an approaching storm while navigating through a series of randomly spawning obstacles and collecting power-ups to survive longer.

As the game progresses, the speed increases, raising the difficulty and intensity. The immersive gameplay is enhanced with:

Parallax scrolling background for depth

Dynamic weather effects

Visually upgraded player, coins, and obstacles

Power-ups for temporary boosts

Storm chase animation

Background music and sound effects

Score tracking system


I built this using Amazon Q CLI, letting AI help me structure and generate chunks of code based on prompts. It was fun collaborating with the assistant like a pair programmer. I learned how to blend AI-assisted coding with creative game design and improve my skills with Pygame in the process.

This hands-on experience has been both fun and educational, and I highly recommend others try building their own game ideas with Amazon Q CLI!
